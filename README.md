How many of us have spent an hour-long study session with 20 minutes reviewing material and the other 40 minutes browsing Facebook? I know I haveâ€”more than a few times. 

In this age where I can spend an entire afternoon scrolling down my timeline watching cute cat videos, it can be tough to find a balance between study and leisure. That's why I created Studier.

Studier allows you to study while you surf the web!

Input your list of study items, set your desired interval for questions, and away you go. Enjoy your favorite Facebook cat video or subreddit while Studier asks you questions so you can study at your leisure.

Step 1) Input questions and answers in the available spots from left to right. To add more slots in the study deck, press "add study item". To remove a study item, delete the text from question and answer and then it will be removed on the next page reload.

Step 2) Set your desired study interval in minutes and seconds. Don't worry, you can stop the study session and change the interval if you end up wanting a different question-rate.

Step 3) Press start and answer the question prompts as they appear. Press stop at any time if you want a full study break.

Step 4) Ace your exam!
